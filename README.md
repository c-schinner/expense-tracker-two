# expense-tracker-two

 This updated version of my expense tracker has a much better UI and is more estheticly pleasing. Using TailwindCSS for all styling.

 Simply input your total monthly income, and as you update your categories the total expenses and leftover monthly total will automatically be updated.

 Users can delete inputs in each category and the totals are updated accordingly.
